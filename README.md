Linx_Web_Server
===============

A simple python HTTP Web Server

This script creates an HTTP Server to server pages. It will only server one page which is the index page.
Make sure you start it on an available port and I.P (Loopback will work, obviously) 

Make sure you have GTK installed before you run the script. You can download GTK here http://www.pygtk.org/.

Still work in progress though.
