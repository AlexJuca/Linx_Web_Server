This is a simple Web Server I created to learn more about the HTTP protocol
It has a simple GUI and console. The GUI uses GTK+ so you might have to download that if you don't already have it on your machine.

Compiles with Python 3.4

Create a new index.html and save it in /var/www/

To run type: sudo python3.4 Linx_WebServer.py

INFO: You can start the server on any internal I.P Address. It will not bind to an external Internet connected I.P Address!

Oh and BTW, Have fun!
