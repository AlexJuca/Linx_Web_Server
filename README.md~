This is a simple Web Server I created to learn more about the HTTP protocol
It has a simple GUI and console. The GUI uses GTK+ so you might have to download that if you don't already have it on your machine.

Compiles with Python 3.4

You must copy index.html and save it in /var/www/

To run type: sudo python3.4 Linx_WebServer.py

INFO: You can bind the server on any internal I.P Address or loopback default is 127.0.0.7 . 

Oh and BTW, Have fun!
